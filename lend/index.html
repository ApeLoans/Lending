            <h2>Information for Lenders</h2>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Earn competitive interest rates on your $APE. Your funds are secured by NFT or token collateral, reducing risk.</p>
            <p><strong>Terms:</strong> Choose your loan duration, and set your interest rate. Loans are automatically matched with borrowers based on your terms.</p>
            <p><strong>Risks:</strong> While collateral protects your funds, there’s a risk of NFT value fluctuation. In case of default, collateral can be set to liquidate, and you receive 50%-75% of the liquidated profits in $LOAN.</p>
            <p><strong>Fees:</strong> No fees for lenders. Borrowers pay a 2.5% $APE fee plus Oracle data costs, ensuring you receive your full interest.</p>
